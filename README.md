# ☕ Nespresso – QA Architect Case Study

End-to-End Test Automation Framework for **[https://dotesthere.com/](https://dotesthere.com/)**

---

## 📌 Objective

Design and implement a clean, maintainable, and scalable automation solution that covers:

* ✅ UI automation (dynamic interactions)
* ✅ API automation (CRUD operations)
* ✅ CI pipeline execution
* ✅ Automated test reporting
* ✅ Clear architectural documentation

The focus is **architecture and quality of design**, not quantity of tests.

# 🏗 Architecture Overview

This project follows a **layered test automation architecture**:

```
src
 ├── main
 │   ├── api           → API client layer
 │   ├── pages         → Page Object Model (UI abstraction)
 │   ├── base          → Base test setup (Playwright config)
 │   └── reports       → Extent report manager & listener
 │
 └── test
     ├── tests
     │   ├── ui        → UI test scenarios
     │   └── api       → API CRUD scenarios
```

# 🖥 UI Test Coverage

Website: [https://dotesthere.com/](https://dotesthere.com/)

### ✔ Test 1 – Add/Remove Elements

* Click **Add Element**
* Verify button appears dynamically
* Remove element
* Verify element disappears

### ✔ Test 2 – Challenging DOM

* Interact with dynamic table
* Perform delete operation
* Validate DOM update

✔ Demonstrates:

* Dynamic element handling
* Assertion validation
* Page Object abstraction
* Stable selector strategy

---

# 🔌 API Test Coverage

Using public API endpoints from the application.

### ✔ Create User

* POST request
* Validate status 201
* Capture ID

### ✔ Read User

* GET request
* Validate response body

### ✔ Update User

* PUT request
* Validate updated fields

### ✔ Delete User

* DELETE request
* Validate 204 response

✔ Demonstrates:

* Full CRUD lifecycle
* Response validation
* Status code verification
* Reusable API client abstraction

---

# 🧱 Framework Design Decisions

### 1️⃣ Separation of Concerns

* Page Objects handle UI logic only.
* API Client handles HTTP operations.
* Tests contain only validation logic.

### 2️⃣ Reusability

* BaseTest centralizes Playwright setup.
* Thread-safe reporting.
* Shared configuration.

### 3️⃣ Maintainability

* Clear package structure.
* No hardcoded test logic inside utilities.
* Minimal duplication.

### 4️⃣ Reliability

* Explicit waits handled by Playwright.
* Independent test execution.
* Clean setup & teardown lifecycle.

---

# 📊 Reporting

Reporting is implemented using **Extent Reports**.

After each run:

```
test-output/ExtentReport.html
```

Report includes:

* Test summary
* Pass/Fail status
* Exception details
* Execution timeline

---

# 🚀 How To Run Tests Locally

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 2️⃣ Run All Tests

```bash
mvn clean test
```

### 3️⃣ Open Report

Open:

```
test-output/ExtentReport.html
```

---

# 🔄 CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The CI pipeline performs:

1. Checkout repository
2. Set up Java
3. Install dependencies
4. Run tests
5. Generate report
6. Upload report artifact

### Example Workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: Automation CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Run UI & API Tests
    runs-on: windows-latest
    timeout-minutes: 20

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Java 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: 17
          cache: maven

      - name: Verify Maven Version
        run: mvn -version

      - name: Clean & Install (Skip Tests)
        run: mvn clean install -DskipTests

      - name: Execute Test Suite
        run: mvn clean test

      - name: Upload Extent Report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: extent-report
          path: test-output/ExtentReport.html

      - name: Upload Surefire Reports
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: surefire-results
          path: target/surefire-reports/
```

# 📈 Scalability Considerations

This framework can be extended to support:

* Parallel execution
* Cross-browser execution
* Environment configuration
* Docker execution
* Test data management
* Retry analyzer
* Advanced logging
* Allure reporting (optional upgrade)

---

# 🧠 Architectural Justification

The solution emphasizes:

✔ Clean abstraction layers
✔ Clear separation between UI & API
✔ CI-ready structure
✔ Deterministic test execution
✔ Maintainable code organization
✔ Reporting integration

The design supports scaling to enterprise-level automation with minimal refactoring.
